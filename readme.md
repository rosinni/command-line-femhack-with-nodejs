# Command line for femhack with
** ‚öíÔ∏è Technologies: Nodejs, chalk, inquirer, figlet ** 

## Challenge Description

_Imagine you are Jean Jennings Bartik and you have a nice computer. You want an easy way to send the information about those ballistic trajectories and how to compute them as fast as possible with a simple CLI._

_So your task would be to design the following CLI ( Command-Line Interface) that allows your mates to do the following:_

Introduce the following data:
* Initial velocity (v0)
* Launch angle (alpha)
* Ask if the results want to be saved into a file
* Select the way to introduce the data (JSON or Manual)
* Compute the maximum height of the projectile (h_max)
h_m√°x = ( v0 * v0 ) * sin(alfa) * sin(alfa) / ( 2 * g ) 

* Calcular la distancia m√°xima recorrida
x_max = (v0 * v0) * sin(2*alfa) / g

* Guarde los datos calculados (Entradas + Resultados) en un archivo

## Quick Start

To run and start using this project you must run the following command lines:

```sh
$ npm install (to install pip packages)
$ femhack (run cli )
```
